**Our team is preparing to develop an educational platform tailored to primary and secondary school students based on a large-model recommendation algorithm. The platform aims to provide comprehensive learning support and management services for students, teachers, and parents. The software is expected to integrate multiple functions, outlined as follows:

(1) Personalized Course Recommendations: Based on students' learning needs, interests, and study history, the system will recommend suitable course content to help them study more effectively.

(2) Diversified Learning Resources: Integrating various learning resources, including videos, documents, and practice questions, allowing students to access knowledge in diverse ways to enhance the interest and depth of learning.

(3) Learning Progress Tracking: Recording students' learning progress and grades, generating learning reports and feedback to help students understand their learning situation and adjust their study plans promptly.

(4) Interactive Discussion Community: Establishing a learning community where students can exchange ideas and share learning experiences, fostering a conducive learning atmosphere and stimulating learning motivation.

(5) Learning Task Management: Setting learning tasks and plans to help students manage their study time effectively and improve learning efficiency.

Our platform will utilize an advanced technology stack, including Vue.js framework and Vite build tool for the frontend, Electron desktop application framework, FastAPI framework, and LangChain technology for the backend.

In terms of design features, we will focus on the following aspects:

(1) Large-Model Recommendation Algorithm: By leveraging large-model technology, we will provide customized course recommendations for each primary and secondary school student based on their learning habits, interests, and other personalized information, helping them learn more quickly and effectively.

(2) Integration of Natural Language Processing and Recommendation Algorithms: Combining LangChain technology, we will achieve more intelligent natural language processing and recommendation algorithms, providing users with more accurate learning resource recommendations to enhance learning effectiveness.

(3) Cross-Platform Support: Utilizing the Electron desktop application framework, we will enable cross-platform functionality, allowing users to seamlessly switch between different devices for learning, thereby improving learning flexibility and convenience.

Through the implementation of the above functions and design features, we aim to create a comprehensive and personalized learning platform for primary and secondary school students, helping them better grasp knowledge, improve learning outcomes, and cultivate independent learning skills and lifelong learning awareness. These features will provide students with support and guidance, making their learning process easier and more enjoyable.**
